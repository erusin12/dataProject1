# STOP, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

## Project Description

**Description:** Our hypothesis is that COVID may have resulted in the decrease of arrest numbers in Baltimore City. We are examining Baltimore Cityâ€™s arrest data compiled by the police department in 2010 through 2022. We had three questions to answer at the end of the project and these are: (i) did covid impact overall arrests for the city of Baltimore? (ii)did covid impact the type of charges? (iii) did covid change the geography of arrest locations?(comparing during and after covid)

## Installation/setup: 
-Import the dataset containing Baltimore Police Department arrest records
- Clean and prepare the data by removing duplicates, missing values, and outlier detection techniques 
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insight into trends, distributions, and patterns 
- Analyze the effect of different factors on the number of police department arrests 
- Group the arrest records according to their charge codes and investigate the distribution of charges throughout the year 
-Compare the prevalence of certain types of arrests

## Description

- Load the CSV file located on BPD website into a Pandas DataFrame and display data

- Define the desired time frame

- Convert date values to EST timezone and filter the data based on the time frame

- Apply the filter to get the narrowed down data to extract month and year from the arrestdatetime column

- Isolate the 2018 data for mapping to define latitutde and longitude and remove the nulls
  
- Create a map to combine latitudes and longitudes into list. Display the map

- Isolate the 2019 data for mapping to define latitutde and longitude and remove the nulls
  
- Create a map to combine latitudes and longitudes ito list. Display the map

- Isolate the 2020 data for mapping to define latitutde and longitude and remove the nulls
